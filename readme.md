### Rationale for this project :
________

For this project, we were put in a team of 4, and we were asked to use all our new PHP skills, as well as everything we learned in front-end development (HTML, CSS and JS). This is the first fill stack project we've done.

Another reason for this project was to familiarize ourselves with MySQL and the SQL language. We had to learn how to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) data in a mysql database.

BreakingBadge is a functional prototype for editing and deleting badges. 

## What have we done?

One of the things we had to do for this project was to create accounts for users and admins. Depending on whether you are an admin or a user, you will see different things on the website and have different privileges.

There were many aspects to this project that we can first break down into front and back end tasks.


*Front-end:*
-------

The first half of our team took care of the creation of the home page, the login page and the content of the users' profiles once they successfully logged in. Once logged in, the user can see his profile and all the badges he has received.

Each user has a profile modal section where they can see their first name, last name and email address. 

The user also has the option of logging out of the account and returning to the login page. 

All the pages of our website also have different screen sizes, making it easily accessible and pleasant to look at.


*Back:*
------

The team worked on linking a PHPMyAdmin database composed of 3 tables to our website, and found out how to create, read, link, delete and modify data in our database, directly from the PHP website by connecting our PHP to the database via SQL. 

When entering the login page, the user can only login with an existing account created by an admin.


What did we learn from this experience:


This project taught us many things, but most importantly, it taught us teamwork. We had daily meetings at the start and end of the day to discuss what everyone's tasks will 
be for the day. We managed to break down this project into trackable tasks for everyone to complete. This teamwork is also apparent when we consider that two people worked on 
the aspect of our website, while the other two people worked on the functionality and integration of MySQL with the website. Linking the two sections together was challenging 
at times, especially when merging branches on GitHub, but we powered through it an got a better taste of what a real life group project looks like. We will all be better 
equipped to work in teams in the future.

Furthermore, we learned how personalisable and how many possibilities there are with integrating a database into our website. We can create, read, update and delete data from 
the database directly on PHPMyAdmin, in the PHP website code and also as a user, directly on the website!

Also, we learned how to carry out a password hash, and why it is so important to do, as an additional security measure!

It should be mentioned that this project also refreshed some concepts we have already learned in HTML, CSS and Javascript, by creating a beautiful and responsive website.

Problems encountered:
During the first couple of days, we encountered major problems with PHP. But with the help of our colleagues, we succedeed on creating and implementing PHP functions. 

Within day 4 of the project, we attempted merging branches on github, but after merging the back-end and the front-end branches, the CSS was not responding properly on all the 
screens, depending on who's screen we were streaming the website from at the time.

In conclusion, it was the biggest project we had to do. Thanks to the "breaking badge" project, we were ready for it though. 

Conclusion

We created Breaking_Badge, a functional, integrated, full-stack prototype for granting badges to users.
